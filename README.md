##### DEVELOPMENT SETUP

It is important that Docker is installed so that the application can be started locally. You must first remove all `_example` from the `.env` and `.env.local`. So that the environment variables can be used for the application.
After that, the application can be started with a `docker compose up` in the root folder.
